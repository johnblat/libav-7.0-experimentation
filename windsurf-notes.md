okay, do you know how much time it takes to decode one frame? How is this compared to the amount of time it takes display a frame?

Let me analyze the decoding and display timing in FFmpeg:

Analyzed

ffplay.c
Looking at the code, we can see that FFmpeg actually measures and tracks these timings. Let me explain the key timing aspects:

Decoding Time:
FFmpeg tracks the time between when a frame is requested and when it's returned from the decoder
This is measured in video_thread() using av_gettime_relative()
The timing includes:
Hardware/software decoding of the compressed frame
Any filtering operations (if video filters are applied)
Format conversions if needed
Display Time:
The display timing is managed in the video_refresh() function
Each frame has a target display time calculated based on:
The frame's PTS (Presentation Time Stamp)
The current clock time
The frame duration (1/framerate)
Key Timing Measurements:
c
CopyInsert
is->frame_last_returned_time = av_gettime_relative() / 1000000.0;
// ... frame processing ...
is->frame_last_filter_delay = av_gettime_relative() / 1000000.0 - is->frame_last_returned_time;
Comparison:
Decoding time is typically much shorter than the display interval for modern hardware
For example, at 30fps, each frame should be displayed for ~33.3ms
Modern hardware can often decode H.264/H.265 frames in 1-5ms
However, actual timings depend heavily on:
Video resolution
Codec complexity
Hardware capabilities
Whether hardware acceleration is being used
Performance Monitoring:
FFmpeg includes a threshold AV_NOSYNC_THRESHOLD (default 10 seconds)
If processing time exceeds this threshold, it indicates serious performance issues
The system will drop frames if decoding falls too far behind display time
The key insight is that FFmpeg is designed assuming that decoding time should be significantly less than display time. If decoding takes longer than the frame display interval, the player will start dropping frames to maintain synchronization with audio.

i'm going to be making a frame-by-frame analysis tool. I think in this case, i will need to have a much larger frame queue/buffer. Also, it will have the ability to step backwards. When stepping backwards i want to make sure that it will be able to quickly display frames (both in a timeline, and as a full-size image). What limitations on memory size should i set for this?

For a frame-by-frame analysis tool, let's calculate the memory requirements and set appropriate limits:

Memory Per Frame Calculation:
For a 1080p frame (1920x1080):
YUV420: ~3.1 MB per frame (1920 × 1080 × 1.5 bytes)
RGB24: ~6.2 MB per frame (1920 × 1080 × 3 bytes)
RGB32: ~8.3 MB per frame (1920 × 1080 × 4 bytes)
For 4K (3840x2160):
YUV420: ~12.4 MB per frame
RGB24: ~24.9 MB per frame
RGB32: ~33.2 MB per frame
Recommended Buffer Sizes:
For Timeline Thumbnails:

Store scaled-down versions (e.g., 160x90):
RGB24: ~43 KB per thumbnail
Can safely store many thumbnails (e.g., 1000 frames = ~43 MB)
For Full-size Frames:

Assuming 16GB system memory:
Reserve 25% for system/application (~4GB)
For 1080p content: can buffer ~500 full RGB frames
For 4K content: buffer ~120 full RGB frames
Recommended Implementation:

cpp
CopyInsert
struct FrameBuffer {
    // For quick timeline navigation
    struct Thumbnail {
        static const int WIDTH = 160;
        static const int HEIGHT = 90;
        static const size_t MAX_THUMBNAILS = 1000;
        // ~43MB for 1000 160x90 RGB thumbnails
    };

    // For full-frame display
    struct FullFrame {
        static const size_t MAX_1080P_FRAMES = 500;  // ~3.1GB for YUV420
        static const size_t MAX_4K_FRAMES = 120;     // ~1.5GB for YUV420
    };

    // Total memory limits (adjustable based on system memory)
    static const size_t MAX_MEMORY_USAGE = 4ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024;  // 4GB
};
Memory Management Strategy:
Use a sliding window approach:
Keep thumbnails for a larger range of frames
Keep full-size frames for the immediate vicinity of current position
Implement memory monitoring:
Track system memory usage
Dynamically adjust buffer sizes
Implement frame eviction when memory pressure is high
Optimization Suggestions:
Store full frames in YUV420 format (smaller size)
Convert to RGB only when displaying
Use memory mapping for quick backward seeking
Implement progressive loading for timeline view
Consider GPU memory for frequently accessed frames
Performance Considerations:
Pre-decode frames in both directions
Cache decoded frames to disk for long sequences
Implement asynchronous loading for smooth UI
Use multiple resolution levels for different viewing modes
Would you like me to help implement any specific part of this system? We could start with either the frame buffer management or the thumbnail generation system.

okay, let's impose a 2GB limit for this software. I also should state i want to make a comparison app that can compare multiple video streams. Let's say i want to compare 5 different streams. What are some thoughts regarding memory usage?

For comparing 5 video streams within a 2GB total memory limit, we need to be strategic about memory allocation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Memory Budget (2GB total):
cpp
CopyInsert
struct MemoryBudget {
    static const size_t TOTAL_MEMORY = 2ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024;  // 2GB
    static const size_t SYSTEM_RESERVE = 256ULL * 1024 * 1024;     // 256MB for app code/UI
    static const size_t STREAM_MEMORY = TOTAL_MEMORY - SYSTEM_RESERVE;  // ~1.75GB for streams
    static const size_t PER_STREAM = STREAM_MEMORY / 5;  // ~350MB per stream
};
Per-Stream Allocation (350MB each):
cpp
CopyInsert
struct StreamBuffer {
    // For 1080p YUV420 (~3.1MB per frame)
    static const size_t FULL_FRAMES_1080P = 50;  // ~155MB
    
    // For thumbnails (160x90 RGB, ~43KB each)
    static const size_t THUMBNAIL_COUNT = 4000;   // ~172MB
    
    // Reserve for working buffer
    static const size_t WORKING_BUFFER = 23 * 1024 * 1024;  // 23MB
};
Memory Management Strategy:
cpp
CopyInsert
class MultiStreamComparer {
    struct StreamState {
        static const int THUMBNAIL_WIDTH = 160;
        static const int THUMBNAIL_HEIGHT = 90;
        
        // Active frame window (sliding window of full frames)
        static const int FULL_FRAME_WINDOW = 50;  // 25 frames before and after current position
        
        // Thumbnail ranges
        static const int CLOSE_RANGE_THUMBS = 1000;   // Higher quality, closer to current position
        static const int FAR_RANGE_THUMBS = 3000;     // Lower quality, further from position
    };
    
    // Memory-saving techniques
    enum class QualityLevel {
        THUMBNAIL_FAR,     // 160x90 JPEG quality 70
        THUMBNAIL_NEAR,    // 160x90 JPEG quality 85
        FULL_FRAME        // Original resolution YUV420
    };
};
Optimization Strategies:
a) Hierarchical Storage:

cpp
CopyInsert
struct FrameStorage {
    // Level 1: Currently visible frames (highest quality)
    std::deque<FullFrame> activeFrames;  // 5-10 frames per stream
    
    // Level 2: Near-timeline frames (medium quality)
    std::map<int64_t, Thumbnail> nearThumbnails;  // ±500 frames
    
    // Level 3: Far-timeline frames (lower quality)
    std::map<int64_t, Thumbnail> farThumbnails;   // ±2000 frames
};
b) Smart Loading:

cpp
CopyInsert
class StreamLoader {
    // Load frames based on visibility and importance
    enum class LoadPriority {
        VISIBLE_FRAME,     // Currently displayed
        ADJACENT_FRAME,    // Next/previous frames
        TIMELINE_THUMB,    // Timeline thumbnails
        BACKGROUND_LOAD    // Preemptive loading
    };
};
Implementation Recommendations:
cpp
CopyInsert
class VideoComparison {
public:
    // Efficient frame access
    void seekToFrame(int64_t frameNumber) {
        for (auto& stream : streams_) {
            stream.prepareFrameWindow(frameNumber);
        }
        updateComparison();
    }
    
    // Memory-aware frame loading
    void prepareFrameWindow(int64_t center) {
        // Unload distant frames
        unloadFramesOutsideWindow(center, WINDOW_SIZE);
        
        // Load new frames with priority
        loadFrameWindow(center - WINDOW_SIZE/2, center + WINDOW_SIZE/2);
        
        // Generate thumbnails if needed
        ensureThumbnailsExist(center - THUMB_WINDOW, center + THUMB_WINDOW);
    }
    
private:
    static const size_t WINDOW_SIZE = 50;
    static const size_t THUMB_WINDOW = 4000;
    std::vector<StreamBuffer> streams_;
};

What would you think about saving some "cached" AVPackets that are not decoded, and storing "cached" SDL_Textures for display purposes? The idea is that these packets would be available for quick decoding... Or are there considerations i am not taking into accout? For example, say we want to seek to a much earlier time, will having the packets cached save much time, or do we need to decode N number of packets from the keyframe to the desired frame to get to a specific frame?

This is a great question about caching strategy. Let me break down the considerations:

Caching AVPackets: Pros:
Much smaller memory footprint than decoded frames
For example, a 1080p H.264 frame might be:
Compressed (AVPacket): ~10-50KB
Decoded (AVFrame): ~3.1MB (YUV420)
Useful for forward seeking
Cons:

Due to inter-frame compression, you can't just decode a single packet:
I-frames (keyframes): Can be decoded independently
P-frames: Need previous frames
B-frames: Need both previous and future frames
You'd need to store all packets from the last keyframe to your target frame
Keyframes typically occur every 12-300 frames (depending on encoder settings)
Caching SDL_Textures: Pros:
Immediate display (no GPU upload needed)
Perfect for back/forward stepping
Great for timeline thumbnails
Cons:

Uses GPU memory (limited resource)
Large memory footprint
May need to recreate if GPU context is lost
Here's a proposed hybrid approach:

cpp
CopyInsert
class SmartFrameCache {
    struct CacheRegion {
        static const int TEXTURE_WINDOW = 20;     // Immediate display
        static const int DECODED_WINDOW = 100;    // Quick access
        static const int PACKET_WINDOW = 300;     // Fast forward/backward within GOP
    };

    struct PacketCache {
        // Store packets from last keyframe
        std::map<int64_t, AVPacket*> packets;
        int64_t lastKeyframePos = -1;
        
        bool canDirectDecode(int64_t targetPos) {
            return (targetPos >= lastKeyframePos) && 
                   packets.contains(targetPos);
        }
    };

    struct TextureCache {
        // LRU cache for SDL_Textures
        std::list<std::pair<int64_t, SDL_Texture*>> textures;
        size_t maxTextures = CacheRegion::TEXTURE_WINDOW;
        
        void addTexture(int64_t pos, SDL_Texture* tex) {
            if (textures.size() >= maxTextures) {
                SDL_DestroyTexture(textures.back().second);
                textures.pop_back();
            }
            textures.push_front({pos, tex});
        }
    };
};
Seeking Strategy:
cpp
CopyInsert
class SmartSeeker {
public:
    enum class SeekMethod {
        DIRECT_TEXTURE,    // Immediate display from texture
        CACHED_DECODE,     // Decode from cached packets
        KEYFRAME_SEEK      // Full seek to nearest keyframe
    };

    SeekMethod determineSeekMethod(int64_t currentPos, int64_t targetPos) {
        if (textureCache_.hasTexture(targetPos))
            return SeekMethod::DIRECT_TEXTURE;
            
        if (packetCache_.canDirectDecode(targetPos))
            return SeekMethod::CACHED_DECODE;
            
        return SeekMethod::KEYFRAME_SEEK;
    }

    void seekToFrame(int64_t targetPos) {
        switch(determineSeekMethod(currentPos_, targetPos)) {
            case SeekMethod::DIRECT_TEXTURE:
                displayCachedTexture(targetPos);
                break;
                
            case SeekMethod::CACHED_DECODE:
                decodeFromCachedPackets(targetPos);
                break;
                
            case SeekMethod::KEYFRAME_SEEK:
                seekToKeyframeAndDecode(targetPos);
                break;
        }
    }
};
Recommended Implementation:
cpp
CopyInsert
class FrameAnalyzer {
    struct CacheConfig {
        // Memory limits
        static const size_t MAX_PACKET_CACHE = 100 * 1024 * 1024;  // 100MB per stream
        static const size_t MAX_TEXTURE_CACHE = 200 * 1024 * 1024; // 200MB per stream
        
        // Frame windows
        static const int TEXTURE_RADIUS = 10;  // ±10 frames around current position
        static const int PACKET_RADIUS = 150;  // ±150 frames for quick seeking
    };

    void updateCaches(int64_t currentPos) {
        // Update texture cache window
        ensureTexturesLoaded(
            currentPos - CacheConfig::TEXTURE_RADIUS,
            currentPos + CacheConfig::TEXTURE_RADIUS
        );

        // Update packet cache window
        ensurePacketsCached(
            currentPos - CacheConfig::PACKET_RADIUS,
            currentPos + CacheConfig::PACKET_RADIUS
        );
    }
};
Key Recommendations:
Hierarchical Caching:
SDL_Textures: Keep very small window (±10 frames) for immediate display
Decoded Frames: Medium window (±50 frames) for quick access
AVPackets: Larger window (±150 frames) from nearest keyframe
Thumbnails: Very large window (±2000 frames) for timeline
Smart Preloading:
Detect user interaction patterns
Preload in likely seek direction
Drop caches in opposite direction
Memory Management:
Monitor GPU memory usage
Implement LRU eviction for textures
Drop packet caches under memory pressure
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or help implement a specific part of the caching system?
